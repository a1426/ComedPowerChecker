# ComedPowerChecker

The purpose of this repository is to inform Comed users when their price rises above or falls below a certain threshold, checked every hour.
The user will be notified when the threshold is crossed, and when it returns to normal.
This program first prompts the user on their thresholds, and then guides them through setting up a disposable email that is able to be accessed by SMTPlib, so that their personal email may be notified.
